Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to learn how to use ENVIRO from https://github.com/klavinslab/enviro. This is a multiplayer
game where each player can try to drive their car "block" around the track while collecting buffs and debuffs.

Challenges:
The hardest challenge was deciding what I wanted to do with the game. At first I had created a maze searching robot which worked pretty well but ultimately I threw all that out to tryout some of the recent updates to ENVIRO. I wanted to try multiplayer so I used the examples given in ENVIRO to create my game. The other challenge I encountered was having the view be zoomed onto each player for separate connected clients but I wasn't able to do it.

How to Play:
First pull this repo and save it to your computer.
Next run a Docker container with v1.6 (possibly later as well!) of ENVIRO.
docker run -p80:80 -p8765:8765 -v $PWD:/source -it klavins/enviro:v1.6 bash
This should setup the ports and provide easy access to ENVIRO
Next type the following command into the terminal: "esm start"
Then type the following command into the terminal: "enviro"
Next navigate using a webbrowser to localhost, you should see a screen with the game connected.
Finally get another friend to join...maybe...I'm not actually certain if it only works as two instances in the same browser
or two different computers.
